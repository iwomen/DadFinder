# 🎮 Dad Finder — My First Public Game Project

This is the **first game I’ve ever made**, and the **first program I’ve ever released** that people can actually download and play.

## 🌱 My Story

I’m what you'd call a complete beginner.

I first encountered Python about 10 years ago — casually flipping through a tutorial some foreign programmer had written for his kid. After that, I followed lots of tech influencers and learned a lot *about* the coding world. But in all those years, I never wrote a single line of real code.

Then ChatGPT came along.

Last year, just for fun and out of curiosity, I used it to help me build this little game. I even made a small tool that reports real-time weather in Bangkok. But I never took things any further.

Until now.

Inspired by creators like **caoz**, I decided to finish what I started. With ChatGPT's help, I packaged my Python game into a standalone `.exe` file — so even people without Python installed can play it.

I’ve had a GitHub account for years, but this is the **first time I’m actually uploading something real.**  
So here it is: my first official “submission.”
